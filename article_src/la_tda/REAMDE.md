Code to reproduce the results (i.e. Table 1.) of the
article [Acceptability Judgements via Examining the Topology of Attention Maps](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.09630v2.pdf).
The code was taken from the [official repository](https://github.com/upunaprosk/la-tda), and we made some minor change
to compute 10 models using 10 different seeds. Code was taken from the Jupyter Notebooks.

It can take several days due to features processing that can take quite some time even with multiprocessing.
